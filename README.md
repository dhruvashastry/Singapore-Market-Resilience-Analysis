# Singapore Market Resilience Analysis
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on selected Singaporean industries using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly Express. It focuses on employment resilience and recovery patterns from 2016–2024, with 2020 as a baseline. By studying how industries responded to the COVID-19 shock, we simulate and evaluate how these sectors might withstand future economic shocks.

#### Metrics for Analysis

Employment Resilience Overview: Compare yearly employment levels (2016–2024) by industry, normalized to 2020 as a baseline.

1. Pre-, During-, and Post-COVID Comparison: Visualize average employment changes across time periods and identify top- and bottom-recovering sectors.
2. Quarterly Employment Trends: Track quarter-on-quarter relative changes and visualize patterns through line and heatmap charts.
3. Recovery by Gender: Examine gender-based differences in employment recovery across sectors.
4. Recovery Speed by Industry: Measure how long each industry took to return to pre-pandemic levels.
5. Employment by Age Group: Analyze long-term employment trends by age band, with annotated year-over-year changes.
